Code RPG
=============

Getting Started
---------------

Welcome to Code RPG, an RPG that gives you full creative control over your players actions. 

Code RPG uses C# code compiled written by you, compiled at runtime, to access details about the games characters, and to instruct the player. 

Docs will help with that!

Use the navigation bar at the top to access the Quick Start Tutorial, or dive straight into the Player and Game documentation if you feel comfortable!
